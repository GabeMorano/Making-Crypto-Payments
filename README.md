# Making Crypto Payments

## Project Overview
This project creates a platform that connects customers with fintech professionals using streamlit. The platform allows users to hire professionals and pay them using Ethereum blockchain technology, demonstrating the integration of blockchain payments into a real-world application.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web interface.
- **Web3.py**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ganache**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development that allows for deploying contracts, developing applications, and running tests.

## Features
- **Ethereum Wallet Integration**: Users can generate an Ethereum wallet and view their balance.
- **Hire and Pay**: Users can hire fintech professionals and pay them in Ether directly through the platform.
- **Transaction Validation**: Users can validate transactions within the app and on Ganache.

## How to Run
To start the application, run the following in the command line where the file is located:
`streamlit run krypto_jobs.py`

## Testing
Ensure that transactions are correctly processed by hiring a candidate and checking the associated Ethereum transaction in Ganache.
